# Jacob Keisling's personal website

## Architecture

This is a [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org) site, using server components.
It's currently deployed using Vercel. (Yes, they got me, for now.)

## Local development

### Installation

At the root, install packages:

```bash
# NVM prefered
nvm use 20
npm i
```

### Usage

Use the standard Next.js commands:

```bash
# Start server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
# Serve
npm run start
```
