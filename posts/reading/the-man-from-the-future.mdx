# Test

_John von Neumann_ was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, engineer and polymath. Von Neumann was regarded as perhaps the mathematician with the widest coverage of the subject in his time and was said to have been "the last representative of the great mathematicians who were equally at home in pure and applied mathematics".

Case 1

Case 2

```python
def fizzbuzz(n: int):
    if n % 5 == 0 and n % 3 == 0:
        print f'{n}, fizzbuzz!'
    elif n % 3 == 0:
        print f'{n}, fizz!'
    elif n % 5 == 0:
        print f'{n}, buzz!'
    else:
        print n
```

### Arbitrary values

If you need to use a one-off `letter-spacing` value that doesnâ€™t make sense to include in your theme, use square brackets to generate a property on the fly using any arbitrary value.

Learn more about arbitrary value support in the [arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values) documentation.
Or read my article on Tailwind [here](/writing/tailwind).

Who is Von Neumann?

- A Martian
- Inventor of game theory
  - Based individual all around
- Inventor of the modern computer architecture
- Inventor of many other sundry items

Why should we care?

1. We owe him a debt of gratitude
2. We need to figure out how to get more Von Neumanns
