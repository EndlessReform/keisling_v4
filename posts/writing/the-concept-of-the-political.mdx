# The Concept of the Political

## Executive Summary

Politics is essential to human nature. It is a primitive field, like morality, aesthetics, or economics. Attempts to remove it usually bring it back in by the back door, and even if it were to disappear, humanity would be degraded thereby.

Just like morality is founded on the moral-immoral dichotomy, economics on profitable-unprofitable, so politics is based on friend-enemy.

Liberalism tries to get rid of politics because it threatens liberty and profit. However, (a) trying to destroy politics merely creates worse wars of all against all (b) Politics is smuggled back in again under other guises (c) Liberal states giving up on politics will be crushed by those that do not.

## Quotes

Just as the economic field is based on the distinction between profitable and unprofitable, aesthetics between beautiful and ugly,

> The specific political distinction to which political actions and motives can be reduced is that between friend and enemy.

What does this mean in practice?

> The political enemy is the other, the stranger, and it is sufficient for his nature that he is, in a specially intense way, existentially something different and alien, so that in the extreme case conflicts with him are possible.

The political adversary is a collective not a personal enemy.
The **state** is the entity that decides the friend-enemy distinction.
The friend-enemy distinction can be smuggled in even from a

All political terminology inherently contains at least some polemical meaning:

> All political concepts, images, and terms have a polemical meaning. They are focused on a specific conflict and are bound to a concrete situation; the result (which manifests itself in war or revolution) is a friend-enemy grouping, and they turn into empty and ghostlike abstractions when this situation disappears. Words such as state, republic, society, class...are incomprehensible if one does not know exactly who is to be affected, combated, refuted, or negated by such a term. (43)

### Politics and humanity

Theories of the state come from theories of human nature. All serious individuals believe that humanity is evil, but

> As long as man is well off or willing to put up with things, he prefers the illusion of an undisturbed calm and does not endure pessimists. The political adversaries o a clear political theory will, therefore easily refute political phenomena and truths in the name of some autonomous discipline as amoral, uneconomical, unscientific and above all declare this-and this is politically relevant- as a devilry worthy of being combated. (64)

> Everywhere in political history, in foreign as well as in domestic politics, the incapacity or the unwillingness to make this distinction is a symptom of the political end. The aristocratic society in France before the Revolution of 1789 sentimentalized "man who is by nature good- and the virtue of the masses". It is incredible to see the security and unsuspiciousness with which these privileged spoke of the goodness, mildness, and innocence of the people when 1793 was already upon them - _spectale ridicule et terrible_.

### War and the nation-state

**War** is the ultimate state of enmity: The existential negation of the enemy. The unique power of the state is compelling citizens to kill and be killed by the enemy. No pluralistic entity like the church could compel such a thing.

No principle gives anyone a right to kill according to Schmitt; war has merely an existential meaning.

### Liberalism and politics

Liberalism attempts to renounce politics.

> Although liberalism has not radically denied the state, it has, on the other hand, neither advanced a positive theory of state nor on its own discovered how to reform the state, but has attempted only to tie the political to the ethical and to subjugate it to economics. (61)

This is because liberal individualism is completely incompatible with the need to sacrifice oneself for the state.

Thus,

> The state turns into society: on the ethical-intellectual side into an ideological humanitarian conception of humanity, and on the othe rinto an economic-technical system of production and traffic. A politicall united people becomes, on the one hand, a culturally interested public, and, on the other, partially an industrial concern and its employers, partially a mass of consumers. At the intellectual pole, govvernment and power turns into propaganda and mass manipulation, and at the economic pole, control.

> Liberal not only recongizeswith self-evident logithe autonomy of different human realms but drives them toward specializaiton and even toward complete isolation.

In history, this was the 1800s coalition of economics, science, and "morality" against feudalism and politics. Even though the coalition is veyr fraught, all ally themselves against politics.

However, individuals who renounce politics merely put themselves outside the political sphere, and states which renounce the political are foolish:

> No one thinks it possible that the world could, for example, be transformed into a condition of pure morality by the renunciation of every aesthetic or economic productivity. Even less can a people hope to bring about a purely moral or purely economic condition of humanity by evading every political decision. If a people no longer possesses the energy or will to maintain itself in the sphere of politics, the latter will not thereby vanish from the world. Only a weak people will disappear.

If a polity refuses to advance the friend-enemy distinction, that heralds its end. (66)
There can never be wars "in the name of humanity"; as Proudhon says, "Whoever invokes humanity wants to cheat":

> Whenever a state fights a political enemy in the name of humanity, it is not a war for the sake of humanity, but a war wherein a particular state seeks to usurp a universal concept against its military opponent. At the expense of its opponent, it tries to identify itself with humanity in the same way as one can misuse peace, justice, progress, and civilization in order to claim these as one's own and to deny the same to the enemy. (56)

Instead, liberalism merely smuggles politics in by the back door, and becomes all the worse thereby:

> A domination of men based upon pure economics must appear a terrible deception if, by remaining nonpolitical, it thereby evades political responsibility and visibility. Exchange by no means precludes the possibility that one of the contractors experiences a disadvantage and that a system of mutual contracts finally deteriorates into a system of the worst exploitation and repression...the domain of exchange has its narrow limits and its specific categories, and not all things possess an exchange value. No matter how large the financial bribe may be, there is no money equivalent for political freedom and political independence. (73)

Liberalism attempts to deny war. However, fighting a war to end all wars becomes even more of a contradiction:

> Such a war is necessarily unusually intense and inhuman because, by transcending the limits of the political framework, it simultaneously degrades the enemy into moral and other categories and is forced to make of him a monster that must not only be defeated but also utterly destroyed.

> War is condemned but "executions, sanctions, puntiive expeditions, pacifications, protection f treaties, international police, and measures ot assure peace" remain. A war waged to protect or expand economic powe rmust, with the aid of propaganda , turn into a crusade and into the last war of humanity. But this allegedly non-political and apparently even antipolitica system serves existing or newly emerging friend-and-enemy groupings and cannot escape the logic of the political.

Modern definitions of the state - monopoly of violence + defined borders - are as bad as the "featherless biped" definition. Definitions of politics are just as bad, since they assume a definition of the state. This confusion becomes especially harmful in liberal democracies, where:

> The equation $state=politics$ becomes erroneous and deceptive at texactly the moment when state and society penetrate each other. What had been up that point affairs of state become thereby social matters, and, vice versa, what had been purely social matters become affairs of state - as must necessarily occur in a democratically organized unit. Heretofore ostensibly neutral domains - religion, culture, education, the economy - then cease to be neutral in the sense that they do not pertain to state and to politics.

p.38: Making the common [[The Demon in Democracy by Ryszard Legutko]] point that democracy is a total ideology:

> 'Democracy...blurs the boundaries between state and society and looks to the state for the things that society will most likely refuse to do, while maintainign apermanent condition of argument and change and ultimately vindicating the right to work and subsistence for certain castes'
