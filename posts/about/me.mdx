# About me

**I’m a fourth-year CS major at the University of Chicago.** After graduation, I’ll be working as a UX developer for Blue Cross of Illinois, building their Fiber design system. I'm most passionate about interface design and front-end / native development, though I dabble in data science and print design. For more on my skills and experience, check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-keisling-b474a7174/).

## Hobbies

In my free time,

- I serve as design editor for [_Animus Classics Journal_](https://voices.uchicago.edu/animus/) (check out our [fall issue](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/66328266/animus-classics-journal-vol-2-issue-1)!)
- I'm studying Japanese (currently languishing in the [intermediate plateau](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/gcnryw/the_intermediate_plateau_revisited/) around JLPT N3) and know enough Latin to get by with the Vulgate or post-medieval texts.
- I build custom keyboards - see [here]() for a full list

## Uses this

In the style of [usesthis](https://usesthis.com/) interviews, these are the tools I use on a daily basis:

### Hardware

![](/images/desk.jpg)
I do most of my work on my Windows desktop (with Ubuntu over WSL). The specs are decent enough for gaming and development: CPU - R5-5600x, GPU - GTX 1080 Ti, 32 GB RAM, 1.5 TB SSD. As much as I dislike Windows 10, its non-integer DPI scaling, game compatibility, and WSL layer still keep me on it.

For peripherals:

- I use two 27-inch monitors - a [4k Dell U2720Q](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-monitor-u2720q/apd/210-avjv/monitors-monitor-accessories) on the left for color-accurate work and writing / coding, and a 1440p 144hz Dell S2716DG on the left for gaming and extra real estate. I considered ultrawide, but retina text is a _sine qua non_ for me and there are no good, cheap ultrawides with more than 1440p resolution.
- I have a _lot_ of keyboards, but my daily driver is a 60% custom board with [T1 tactile switches](https://divinikey.com/products/durock-t1-tactile-switch) and [SA Oblivion keycaps](https://drop.com/buy/drop-oblotzky-sa-oblivion-v2). The legends aren't just for show; macros for math symbols and Git commands are on separate function layers.

- For my mouse, I use a [Logitech G502](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g502-hero-gaming-mouse.html) - it's popular for a reason.
- For audio, I use a pair of [Phillips SHP9500](https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/philips/shp9500) headphones

While traveling,

- **For content consumption, writing, and note-taking,** I use an [iPad Pro (2018)](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FTXN2LL/A/refurbished-11-inch-ipad-pro-wi-fi-64gb-space-gray?fnode=9016a1301b540096574411c7ec7b39d9c84c41f0f4c2bd396214f3f267bd64d6a3ba200009e372ca94f27c9248a59d51a42552e047fc36e7047c414ca8b1e7b4ded5d1932365193a26d97fe7f7fffe18) with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil. No, iPads can't replace a real computer for serious work, but for academics and everything else they're a joy to use.
- **For coding and Figma,** I use a XPS 13 9370 (2018) running Arch Linux with i3wm. Battery life is abysmal and the 8th-gen Intel processor is very much showing its age, but the build quality and 4k screen are still excellent even four years after purchase.
- I use an iPhone 12 Pro

**For audio,** I use a pair of AirPods Max or AirPods Pro. Neither are worth the money, but they're quite pleasant to use.

### Software

**For software development,** I use VS Code with [Vim](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/beginners-guide-vim) keybindings, and stock Vim at the terminal. Vim movement commands are an excellent investment, but replicating IDE features like jump to definition, debugging, and autocomplete in Vim just isn't worth it.

**For writing,** I use [Typora](https://typora.io/) for one-off documents and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I've used Obsidian for two years and over 200,000 words of notes, and the hype is real:

**For spaced repetition,** I use this [Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) which lets me write SRS questions directly inline with my notes.

**For design,** I use Figma for UI work and InDesign (sadly) for print.

**For everything else,** I use Signal for messaging, Fastmail for email (PSA: Get email on your own domain if you haven't already), Things and Streaks for task management, and Spotify for music.

## Academic interests

- **History of East Asia, 1853-present,** particularly Yushin-era South Korea and occupied Manchukuo
- **History of innovation,** particularly during the US postwar era
- **Technology for handling complexity:**
  - Usability
  - Tools for thought
  - Information architecture
  - Management technology
